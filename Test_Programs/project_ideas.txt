Just a list of things that need doing:
 - Allow for the use of an image or icon as the face of a button
 - Allow for the use of an icon and text as the face of a button
 - Allow for the Text_Input widget to interact with the clipboard so that text can be pasted
 - New widget ideas:
    - clock
    - stopwatch
    - timer
    - scroll page
    - toggle switches
    - slides (different pages that can be flicked through)
    - seperators (lines that can be placed between layouts to visually separate them)
    - graphs and charts

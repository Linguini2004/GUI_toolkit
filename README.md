# GUI_toolkit
I thought I'd try my hand at creating my own GUI toolkit.

This is loosely based on the kivy framework however uses pygame to draw items on the screen.
The point is the user does not interact with pygame themselves.

It is currently in a very crude state and only has 1 layout (Box Layout) and 1 widget (Button) available
